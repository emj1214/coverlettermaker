# coverlettermaker

A side project – an attempt to simplify the cover letter process without losing any of the specificity. 

Since the formula for writing cover letters tends to be uniform across applications, I created the file clcli.py that takes a series of inputs like my info (some of my info is already saved in privatevars.py so I don't have to re-enter it repeatedly), the position, company, hiring manager, what skills I want to highlight, and what problems the team needs solving.

Output is a word doc, and if selected, a pdf. 

Next steps & goals:
- make it even more flexible: add more sentences to rotate through based on the job description
- explore machine learning: based on my previous cover letters, see if it's possible to create a function that outputs sentences I can add
